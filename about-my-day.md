# About my day
## October 16, 2019
**[Epicodus](https://epicenter.epicodus.com/welcome/) day 3**

This morning I woke up at 6 and made tea to soothe my stomach.
I called my uber at 7:30, but he got lost and was circling around the wrong neighborhood.
He arrived outside to pick me up at 7:53, which would inevitably make me late for class.
I made it into the building at 8;14 am and I was late.
It's currently 9:28 am and I'm paired up with Lee, working on this Markdown Language practice.
At noon, there's a lunch speaker coming in, and I will be there listening and taking notes.

_Jordan Brown from Linit is the speaker_
